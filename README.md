# Social-Distancing-Detector
The project focuses upon building a working model that can help us maintain social distancing at all times. The project model would alarm the user through the sound of a buzzer as well as LED light if he/she crosses the threshold safe distance.
This project aims to reduce the potential spread of the disease by utilizing an ultrasonic distance sensor.
The sensor measures the distance between itself and the object in front of it, whether it be an object or a person.
If something comes within a specified limit of the sensor, a buzzer sounds, and LED lights up, therefore signaling that someone or something is within the range of social distancing limit.
